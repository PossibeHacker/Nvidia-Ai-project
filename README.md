# Nvidia-Ai-project


This project is meant to recognize hand gestures so it can then execute things like macros on a computer. The program works by having the user record images of their hand
in a certain shape for for each category and then is able to distinguish between them in real time. I used the juypter notebook to test this and I sourced the code for 
the training program from there. There is an attached file of the images I used to record my program but I would recomend you create your own personal images for the program.
